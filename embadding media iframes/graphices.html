<!-- SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic is a XML language used to make graphics and animations like in HTML canvas. It is a type of vector graphic that may be scaled up or down. SVG is a web standard for vector-based graphics. It is an XML format that defines graphics the tag that we use in this is <svg> -->
